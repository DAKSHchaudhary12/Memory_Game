# Memory Game

Grid of tiles that we can display face up or face down.

Here's how the game works:-

* When the game starts, all tiles are turned face down.

* The player then flips over two cards, selecting them by clicking on them.

* If the two tiles have the same color, they remain face up. If not, they should be flipped face down again after a short delay.
